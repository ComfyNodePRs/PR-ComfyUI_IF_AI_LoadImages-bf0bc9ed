# ComfyUI_IF_AI_LoadImages

This tool enables you to load images from arbitrary folder selections, display previews of the images within subfolders, and output a list of images so you can work with multiple images simultaneously.

## How to Use

1. Select a folder containing images.
2. The file browser will open automatically for folder selection.
3. Copy the path to the clipboard.
4. In **ComfyV1**: paste the path in the node, or in **older Comfy versions**: paste it into the browser message prompt.
5. Set options for images and subfolder inclusion.
6. Click "refresh" to load images based on your selected options.
7. Play the queue.
8. To use a single selected image, switch the option to true and queue the node (execute the workflow).

> **Note:** This is a workaround solution, so it may feel a bit clunky but functions effectively.
